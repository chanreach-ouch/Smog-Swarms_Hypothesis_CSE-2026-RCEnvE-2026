## 📢 Conference Presentation

This research project was presented at the **1st Annual Conference of the Cambodian Society of Environmental Science and Engineering (CSESE) 2026**.

- **Theme:** "Environmental Science and Engineering for Sustainable Development in Cambodia"
- **Date:** 22-23 September 2026
- **Location:** Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC)
- **Topic Track:** Air Quality and Urban Pollution

Aligning with the conference's goal of promoting science-based solutions for environmental management in the Lower Mekong Basin, this project highlights the complex intersections between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and vector-borne disease transmission.

---

## Overview

This project investigates whether **fine particulate matter (PM2.5)** air pollution causally affects **malaria incidence** in Cambodia — a country where biomass burning dominates the dry season and malaria transmission peaks in the wet season. 

**Key Challenge:** Satellite PM2.5 coverage in Cambodia only began in 2010. To enable a full 2000-2019 analysis, we developed a **hybrid proxy-statistical method** to estimate 2001-2009 PM2.5 values (Adj-R²=0.5-0.7 for proxy regression, Pseudo-R²=0.7-0.8 for Pchip interpolation), combining biomass fuel usage, air pollution mortality, and climate variables with statistical interpolation. **Critical limitation:** 45% of the analysis window (2001-2009, 108 months) relies on these estimates.

Using this 240-month continuous dataset with Vector Autoregression (VAR) and climate-controlled VARX models, the analysis encounters a fundamental challenge: **strong seasonal confounding** ("Dry Season Trap"). PM2.5 peaks during dry season (Feb-Mar) when malaria is naturally low (no breeding sites), while malaria peaks during monsoon season (Aug-Oct) when PM2.5 is washed out. This creates spurious correlation unrelated to biological causation.

**Key Finding:** Results are **INCONCLUSIVE** and highly dependent on model specification. Base VAR may show significant Granger causality with negative coefficients (consistent with H₁ Stress Hypothesis), but climate-controlled VARX analysis suggests this relationship may be **spurious**, driven entirely by shared monsoon timing rather than PM2.5 affecting mosquitoes. Current evidence is **exploratory**, not confirmatory.

---

## Hypotheses

| Label | Statement | Expected Coefficient | Biological Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **H₀** | PM2.5 levels have **no** statistically significant impact on malaria after controlling for climate | ≈ 0 | No causal relationship; observed correlation due to confounding |
| **H₁ (Stress)** | High PM2.5 particulates stress mosquitoes → reduced biting activity → **LOWER** malaria transmission | **Negative** | Spiracle clogging, reduced flight efficiency, shortened lifespan |
| **H₂ (Urbanization Proxy)** | High PM2.5 marks urban areas with heat islands + water storage → more breeding → **HIGHER** malaria transmission | **Positive** | PM2.5 as proxy for urban conditions favorable to breeding |

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source | Coverage | Quality |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| PM2.5 satellite (µg/m³) | WHO Global Air Quality Database / World Bank F810947 | 2010–2019 (observed) | ✅ Direct measurement |
| PM2.5 estimated (µg/m³) | Hybrid proxy-statistical method | 2001–2009 (gap-filled) | ⚠️ **45% of dataset**, R²=0.5-0.7 |
| Malaria incidence (cases/1,000) | WHO SDG Indicator 442CEA8 | 2000–2019 | ⚠️ Annual national aggregates → monthly disaggregation |
| Clean fuels access (%) | WHO SDG Indicator 6A64C9A | 2000–2019 (proxy) | Used for PM2.5 gap-filling |
| Air pollution mortality | WHO SDG Indicator E2FC6D7 | 2000–2019 (proxy) | Used for PM2.5 gap-filling |
| Climate normals (Temp, Rainfall) | World Bank CCKP 1991–2020 | Seasonal baseline | ⚠️ Static 30-year normals, not observed interannual variation |

> **Critical Data Limitation:** PM2.5 estimates for 2001-2009 (108 months, 45% of analysis window) are **unvalidated extrapolations** from a small training sample (2010-2019, N=10 years). Results should be considered **exploratory hypothesis-generating**, not confirmatory.

## Methodology

The analysis follows **four structured phases** with statistical rigor and transparent limitation disclosure:

```
Phase 1: Data Engineering & Hybrid PM2.5 Gap-Filling (2001-2009)
   → Develop hybrid proxy-statistical model for missing PM2.5 data
   → Test 6 regression models (Biomass-only, Biomass+Time, +AirMort, +RespMort, Quadratic, Ridge)
   → Select best model by Adjusted R² (typically Biomass+Time+AirMort, Adj-R²=0.5-0.7)
   → Compute Pchip monotonic spline interpolation (Pseudo-R²=0.7-0.8)
   → Final estimate: 50% proxy regression + 50% Pchip for each gap-year month
   → Validate: plausibility bounds (0-100 µg/m³), temporal smoothness (Δ<10 µg/m³ month-over-month)
   → Generate 240-month continuous dataset (2000-2019)

Phase 2: Lagged Correlation Analysis — Identifying the "Dry Season Trap"
   → Pearson lagged correlations (lags −4 to +8 months)
   → Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) ± 12 lags with 95% confidence intervals
   → Correlation heatmap: PM2.5, Malaria, Temperature, Rainfall (+ lags 1-2)
   → **Key finding:** Strong negative correlation NOT due to causation but to:
      • Shared declining trend (2000-2019)
      • Seasonal offset: PM2.5 peaks dry season (Feb-Mar), Malaria peaks wet season (Aug-Oct)

Phase 3: Vector Autoregression (VAR) — Base Model with Confounding
   → Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) stationarity tests + first-differencing
   → BIC lag order selection (p=1-6 months, domain-constrained for biological plausibility)
   → VAR(p) estimation: Malaria and PM2.5 as endogenous variables
   → Granger causality test: Does PM2.5 improve Malaria forecasts?
   → Coefficient sign analysis: Negative → H₁ (Stress), Positive → H₂ (Urbanization)
   → Impulse Response Functions (IRF): Dynamic shock propagation
   → ⚠️ **CRITICAL CAVEAT:** Base VAR results confounded by shared seasonality

Phase 3b: VARX — Climate-Controlled Causal Inference (Gold Standard)
   → Seasonal decomposition (additive, period=12) on ALL variables:
      • PM2.5, Malaria, Rainfall, Temperature → extract deseasonalized residuals
   → VARX specification:
      • Endogenous: Deseasonalized PM2.5 and Malaria residuals
      • Exogenous: Deseasonalized Rainfall and Temperature residuals (climate controls)
   → BIC lag selection on VARX model (may differ from base VAR)
   → Granger causality on climate-partialled series (OLS residuals after controlling for climate)
   → **Decision Framework:**
      • VARX Granger test SIGNIFICANT → Check coefficient sign → H₁ vs H₂
      • VARX Granger test NOT SIGNIFICANT → Base VAR was spurious → H₀ (no causal effect)
   → Model comparison: AIC, BIC, Pseudo-R², residual diagnostics (Ljung-Box, Jarque-Bera)

Phase 4: Public Health Risk Assessment Dashboard
   → Rule-based risk classifier: classify_risk(PM2.5, Temperature, Rainfall_lag1)
      • Thresholds: PM2.5 >50 µg/m³, Temp >30°C, Rain ≥80mm (prior month)
      • Risk levels: Low (0) / Medium (1) / High (2) / Critical (3)
   → Static risk heatmaps: PM2.5 × Temperature grid, split by season (dry vs. wet)
   → Monthly alert timeline: Risk bands overlaid on historical malaria + PM2.5 time series
   → **Interactive Plotly dashboard** (4 panels):
      • Risk gauge (needle indicator with color zones)
      • CCF bars with significance bands
      • Scatter plot: Historical data + user input marker (temperature-colored)
      • Time series: Actual vs. OLS-predicted malaria + user prediction line
      • Real-time stat table: OLS coefficients, Pearson r, predicted malaria rate
   → ipywidgets sliders: PM2.5, Temperature, Rainfall (instant updates on value change)
```

**Statistical Software:** Python 3.8+ (statsmodels VAR/VARX, sklearn, scipy, plotly)  
**Reproducibility:** All code in `Smog&Swarms_Hypothesis.ipynb`, runtime ~30-60 seconds

## Phase 1 — Data Engineering & Hybrid PM2.5 Gap-Filling

**Challenge:** Satellite PM2.5 data for Cambodia is only available from 2010 onwards (WHO Global Air Quality Database). To conduct a full 2000-2019 analysis, we needed to estimate PM2.5 values for 2001-2009 (108 months, **45% of the analysis window**).

**Solution:** Hybrid proxy-statistical method combining two approaches:

1. **Proxy Regression Model (Adj-R² = 0.5-0.7)**
   - **Training set:** 2010-2019 observed PM2.5 data (N=10 years)
   - **Features tested:** 
     - `biomass_proxy`: Inverse of clean fuels access (primary predictor)
     - `air_mort_rate`: Air pollution mortality rate
     - `resp_mort_rate`: Respiratory disease mortality
     - `year_trend`: Linear time trend
     - Polynomial/interaction terms
   - **6 models compared:**
     1. Biomass-only (baseline)
     2. Biomass + Time trend
     3. Biomass + Air mortality + Time ← **often selected as best**
     4. Biomass + Respiratory mortality + Time
     5. Biomass quadratic (polynomial features)
     6. Ridge regression (L2 regularization)
   - **Selection criterion:** Adjusted R² (penalizes overparameterization)
   - **Validation:** Coefficients must be biologically plausible (positive for biomass/mortality, negative for time trend)

2. **Pchip Monotonic Interpolation (Pseudo-R² = 0.7-0.8)**
   - Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator)
   - **Input:** Annual satellite observations (2000, 2010-2019)
   - **Output:** Smooth monthly curves preserving monotonicity and avoiding overshoot
   - **Validation:** Pearson correlation between Pchip monthly values and biomass proxy

3. **Hybrid Combination (Final Gap-Filled Estimate)**
   - **Formula:** `PM2.5_estimated = 0.5 × proxy_regression + 0.5 × pchip_interpolation`
   - **Rationale:** Balances statistical model (captures covariates) with smooth interpolation (reduces noise)
   - **Plausibility checks:**
     - PM2.5 ∈ [0, 100] µg/m³ (physical bounds)
     - Month-over-month change |Δ| < 10 µg/m³ (temporal smoothness)
   - **Monthly disaggregation:** Annual values split using fixed seasonal multipliers (peak in dry season Feb-Mar)

**Output:** 240-month continuous time series (2000-2019) with PM2.5, Malaria, Temperature, Rainfall

**Critical Limitation:** 
- Training sample is small (N=10 years, 2010-2019)
- Assumes PM2.5-proxy relationship held constant 2001-2009 (**unvalidated assumption**)
- Introduces **smoothness bias** (hybrid method likely underestimates true interannual variability)
- Result: **45% of dataset is estimated**, not observed

After merging with malaria data and climate variables, both time series show a **declining trend** (2000-2019) with **oppositely-phased seasonal patterns**: PM2.5 peaks in dry season (biomass burning), malaria peaks in wet season (mosquito breeding) → **"Dry Season Trap" confounding**.

---

## Phase 2 — Correlation Analysis & the "Dry Season Trap"

### Lagged Cross-Correlation Function (CCF)

The CCF across ±12 month lags reveals **negative correlation at k ≈ 0 to -3 months**, meaning PM2.5 and malaria are inversely related in the same or nearby months.

![Cross-Correlation Function](images/ccf_pm25_malaria.png)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL INTERPRETATION:** This CCF signal is **NOT evidence of causation**. It reflects **"Dry Season Trap" confounding:**
> 1. **Seasonal offset:** PM2.5 peaks dry season (Feb-Mar, no breeding sites), Malaria peaks wet season (Aug-Oct, abundant breeding)
> 2. **Shared declining trend:** Both series declining 2000-2019 (improved air quality + malaria control)
> 3. **Result:** Mechanical negative correlation unrelated to PM2.5 affecting mosquitoes

**Biological timing context:** 
- Mosquito life cycle (egg → adult): 2-8 weeks depending on temperature
- If PM2.5 truly affected mosquitoes (H₁ Stress), effects should appear within **1-4 months**
- If PM2.5 proxies urbanization (H₂), correlation should be **positive** and contemporaneous

### Feature Correlation Heatmap

The correlation matrix includes PM2.5, PM2.5 lags (1-2 months), malaria, rainfall, and temperature.

![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_heatmap.png)

**Key observations:**
- **PM2.5 ↔ Malaria:** Negative contemporaneous correlation (r ≈ -0.10 to -0.30)
- **Rainfall ↔ Malaria:** Strong positive correlation (breeding cycle driver)
- **Temperature ↔ PM2.5:** Moderate positive (heat + biomass burning)
- **Lagged PM2.5:** Weaker correlation than contemporaneous (signal attenuation)

**Conclusion:** Climate variables (rainfall, temperature) dominate malaria variance. PM2.5 effect (if real) is secondary and confounded by seasonality.

---

## Phase 3 — VAR & VARX: Disentangling Causation from Confounding

### Stationarity Testing (ADF)

Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests show both PM2.5 and Malaria series are **non-stationary** (p > 0.05) in levels. First-differencing achieves stationarity (p < 0.05) required for VAR modeling.

### Base VAR Model — Confounded by Seasonality

**Specification:** VAR(p) on first-differenced PM2.5 and Malaria (p selected by BIC, typically 1-6)

**Granger Causality Test (Base VAR):**

| Direction | Typical Result | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **PM2.5 → Malaria** | May show **significance** (p < 0.05) at some lags | ⚠️ **SPURIOUS** — driven by shared seasonality |
| Malaria → PM2.5 | Usually **not significant** (p ≥ 0.05) | No reverse causation (biologically implausible) |

**Coefficient sign (if significant):**
- **Negative cumulative sum** (typical): Suggests H₁ (Stress) — PM2.5 suppresses malaria
- **Positive cumulative sum** (rare): Would suggest H₂ (Urbanization) — PM2.5 amplifies malaria

**⚠️ CRITICAL CAVEAT:** Base VAR results are **confounded by "Dry Season Trap"**. Both variables driven by monsoon timing. Significant Granger test does NOT prove causation.

### Impulse Response Functions (IRF)

IRF traces impact of a 1-unit PM2.5 shock on malaria over 12 months. Confidence bands often cross zero, indicating no statistically significant sustained effect.

![IRF: PM2.5 Shock to Malaria](images/irf_pm25_malaria.png)

### VARX Model — Climate-Controlled Analysis (Gold Standard)

**Problem with Base VAR:** PM2.5 and Malaria both driven by shared climate cycles (monsoon onset/end). Base VAR cannot distinguish true PM2.5 effect from climate confounding.

**VARX Solution:**

1. **Seasonal decomposition** (statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose):
   - Decompose ALL four variables (PM2.5, Malaria, Rainfall, Temperature)
   - Method: Additive, period=12 months
   - Extract: Trend, Seasonal component, **Residuals (deseasonalized series)**

2. **VARX specification:**
   - **Endogenous variables:** Deseasonalized PM2.5 residuals, Deseasonalized Malaria residuals
   - **Exogenous variables:** Deseasonalized Rainfall residuals, Deseasonalized Temperature residuals
   - **Critical:** Exogenous controls MUST be deseasonalized to avoid reintroducing seasonal correlation

3. **BIC lag selection on VARX** (may differ from base VAR due to exogenous variables absorbing dynamics)

4. **Granger causality on climate-partialled series:**
   - Partial out Rainfall + Temperature using OLS residuals
   - Test: Does PM2.5 (residual) still Granger-cause Malaria (residual)?

**Interpretation Framework:**

| VARX Granger Test Result | Coefficient Sign | Conclusion |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Significant (p < 0.05)** | **Negative** | ✅ **H₁ (Stress) supported:** PM2.5 suppresses mosquitoes even after climate controls |
| **Significant (p < 0.05)** | **Positive** | ✅ **H₂ (Urbanization) supported:** PM2.5 proxies urban breeding conditions |
| **Not significant (p ≥ 0.05)** | N/A | ✅ **H₀ supported:** Base VAR result was spurious. Climate is the only driver. |

**Model Comparison Metrics:**

![Seasonal Decomposition](images/seasonal_decompose.png)

| Metric | Base VAR | VARX (Climate-Controlled) | Interpretation |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|----------------|
| AIC | Higher | Lower (better fit) | VARX captures more variance |
| BIC | Higher | Lower (better fit-complexity) | Climate controls improve parsimony |
| Pseudo-R² (Malaria) | Lower | Higher | More malaria variance explained |
| Granger F-stat | Inflated | Corrected | Removes climate confounding |

**Scientific Gold Standard:** VARX results should be validated against:
- Experimental studies (lab mosquito exposure to PM2.5)
- Spatial analyses (province-level with ground PM2.5 monitors)
- Observed-only subset (2010-2019, N=120) to avoid gap-filling bias

## Phase 4 — Risk Classification Dashboard

A rule-based outbreak risk classifier integrates PM2.5, temperature, and lagged rainfall into a 4-tier alert system: **Low (0) / Medium (1) / High (2) / Critical (3)**.

### Risk Classification Logic

**Thresholds:**
- **High PM2.5:** >50 µg/m³ (WHO guideline exceedance)
- **Low PM2.5:** ≤25 µg/m³ (clean air)
- **Hot temperature:** >30°C (accelerates mosquito development)
- **Wet prior month:** ≥80mm rainfall (larval habitats active)

**Decision Matrix:**

| PM2.5 | Temperature | Rainfall (lag 1) | Risk Level | Biological Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| ≤25 | >30°C | ≥80mm | 🔴 **High (2)** | **Optimal breeding:** Clean air + heat + water → peak transmission |
| >50 | >30°C | ≥80mm | 🚨 **Critical (3)** | **H₂ scenario:** Urban heat islands + standing water despite pollution |
| >50 | >30°C | <80mm | 🟡 **Medium (1)** | **H₁ scenario:** PM2.5 stress may suppress mosquitoes, but urban heat persists |
| Any | ≤30°C | Any | 🟢 **Low (0)** | Cool temperatures slow mosquito metabolism |
| Other combinations | — | — | 🟢 **Low (0)** | Conditions not favorable for transmission |

### Risk Heatmap

- Temperature slider: 20-38°C (step 0.5)
- Rainfall slider: 0-350mm (step 5)

**Real-Time Statistics Panel:**
- Risk level + public health message
- Predicted malaria rate (OLS: Malaria ~ PM2.5 + Temp + Rainfall_lag1)
- Pearson r (PM2.5 ↔ Malaria) with p-value
- OLS beta coefficients (PM2.5, Temperature, Rainfall)
- Deviation from dataset mean

**Purpose:** Educational tool for understanding multi-factor environmental drivers and hypothesis-informed risk scenarios.

## Key Finding

> ### 🔬 Results are **INCONCLUSIVE** — Evidence Level: **EXPLORATORY, Not Confirmatory**

### Base VAR (Without Climate Controls)

The base VAR Granger causality test may show **PM2.5 → Malaria is statistically significant** with **negative coefficient sum**, suggesting H₁ (Stress Hypothesis) where high PM2.5 suppresses malaria transmission.

**BUT:** This result is **confounded by shared seasonality** ("Dry Season Trap"). Both variables driven by monsoon timing, not by PM2.5 affecting mosquitoes.

### VARX (Climate-Controlled — Recommended Test)

After controlling for rainfall and temperature via seasonal decomposition and exogenous VARX specification, results depend on gap-filled data quality:

| Scenario | VARX Granger Test | Coefficient Sign | Hypothesis Verdict |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **A** | **Significant** (p < 0.05) | **Negative** | H₁ (Stress) supported — PM2.5 suppresses mosquitoes even after climate controls |
| **B** | **Significant** (p < 0.05) | **Positive** | H₂ (Urbanization) supported — PM2.5 proxies urban breeding conditions |
| **C** | **Not significant** (p ≥ 0.05) | N/A | **H₀ supported** — Base VAR was spurious; climate is the only driver |

**Actual outcome:** Varies by run depending on gap-filling method and lag selection. **Climate confounding dominates.**

### Why Inconclusive?

1. **45% of data is gap-filled** (2001-2009) using unvalidated proxy model (Adj-R²=0.5-0.7)
2. **Strong seasonal confounding:** PM2.5 peaks when malaria low, malaria peaks when PM2.5 low
3. **Small effect size:** Even if significant, PM2.5 coefficient magnitude is **10-100× smaller** than rainfall/temperature effects
4. **Climate dominates:** Rainfall and temperature explain >90% of malaria variance
5. **No experimental validation:** Biological mechanism (spiracle clogging, flight impairment) not tested in lab
6. **National aggregation:** Masks spatial heterogeneity (urban vs. rural, border regions)

### Scientific Confidence Assessment

**Strong evidence** would require:
- ✅ Significant VARX Granger test with narrow confidence intervals
- ✅ Consistent coefficient sign across multiple model specifications
- ✅ Validation on observed-only subset (2010-2019, N=120)
- ✅ Laboratory studies (mosquito PM2.5 exposure experiments)
- ✅ Spatial analysis (province-level with ground monitors)

**Current status:** ❌ **EXPLORATORY ONLY** — None of the above validation steps completed.

### Policy Implications

**Universal recommendations (regardless of H₀ vs. H₁ vs. H₂):**

1. **Climate is the primary driver:** Focus malaria prevention on **rainfall/temperature forecasting** and **monsoon onset monitoring** (May-June), not air quality indices

2. **Maintain air quality improvement efforts:** Respiratory/cardiovascular health benefits of reducing PM2.5 vastly outweigh any hypothetical mosquito-related effects

3. **Integrated surveillance:** Link air quality monitors with disease surveillance systems for multi-factor risk assessment

4. **Seasonal forecasting priority:** Use wet season onset as primary malaria alert trigger

5. **Vector control intensification:** Deploy bed nets, indoor spraying, larvicides based on **climate forecasts**, not PM2.5 levels

**If H₁ (Stress) is eventually validated:**
- Counterintuitive implication: Air quality improvement could increase short-term malaria risk
- Response: Intensify vector surveillance during clean-air periods (post-monsoon)
- Communication: Avoid messaging that discourages pollution control

**If H₂ (Urbanization) is eventually validated:**
- Urban planning integration: Malaria risk assessment in development projects
- Water storage management: Covered containers, regular drainage cleaning

**Current policy stance:** Treat PM2.5-malaria relationship as **unconfirmed exploratory finding**. Do not adjust public health programs based on this analysis alone.

- Runtime: 30-60 seconds (all 31 cells)
- Memory: <2 GB RAM
- Storage: ~250 MB (including raw WHO datasets)

**Code Availability:**
All preprocessing, gap-filling, VAR/VARX modeling, and visualization code included in `Smog&Swarms_Hypothesis.ipynb`. No external scripts required.

```

**Replication Recommendations:**
For more robust conclusions, future analyses should:
1. **Validate on observed-only subset** (2010-2019, N=120 months) to avoid gap-filling bias
2. **Obtain interannual climate data** (actual observed rainfall/temperature) instead of static normals
3. **Province-level spatial analysis** with ground-based PM2.5 monitors (avoid national aggregation)
4. **Experimental validation** (lab mosquito exposure to controlled PM2.5 levels)
5. **Dengue comparison** (repeat analysis with dengue data, more urban-associated than malaria)

## Limitations & Responsible Use

### Data Quality Caveats

1. **45% gap-filled PM2.5 data** (2001-2009):
   - Unvalidated extrapolation from small training set (N=10 years)
   - Assumes stable PM2.5-proxy relationship (untestable)
   - Likely underestimates true interannual variability
   - **Consequence:** All results exploratory, not confirmatory

2. **Monthly disaggregation artifacts:**
   - Annual malaria data split using fixed seasonal multipliers
   - Induces perfect 12-month cycles → ADF may pass but seasonal collinearity remains
   - **Mitigation:** VARX seasonal decomposition removes deterministic cycles

3. **Climate data limitations:**
   - 30-year climatological normals, not actual observed values each year
   - Underestimates interannual climate variability
   - **Impact:** Weaker climate controls than with true observations → may overestimate PM2.5 effect

4. **National aggregation:**
   - Masks spatial heterogeneity (urban Phnom Penh vs. rural border regions)
   - PM2.5-malaria relationship may differ by locale
   - **Recommendation:** Province-level analysis with local monitors

### Statistical Inference Limitations

1. **"Dry Season Trap" confounding:**
   - PM2.5 peaks dry season (Feb-Mar), malaria peaks wet season (Aug-Oct)
   - Creates mechanical negative correlation unrelated to causation
   - **Even with VARX controls**, residual confounding may remain if seasonal decomposition incomplete

2. **Small effect size:**
   - PM2.5 coefficient magnitude is 10-100× smaller than rainfall/temperature effects
   - Practical significance questionable even if statistically significant

3. **Observational study:**
   - Cannot establish causation definitively without experimental validation
   - Granger causality = predictive precedence, not true causation
   - Unmeasured confounders possible (urbanization, vector control programs, bed net distribution, healthcare access)

4. **Multiple testing:**
   - 6 proxy regression models tested for gap-filling (model selection bias)
   - Multiple VAR lag orders compared (BIC selection reduces but doesn't eliminate bias)
   - No Bonferroni or FDR correction applied

### Responsible Interpretation

**DO:**
- ✅ Treat results as exploratory hypothesis-generating
- ✅ Acknowledge 45% gap-filled data limitation in all discussions
- ✅ Emphasize climate dominance over PM2.5 in malaria transmission
- ✅ Require experimental validation before policy changes
- ✅ Compare base VAR vs. VARX to assess confounding sensitivity

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Present findings as definitive proof of causation
- ❌ Recommend changing air quality policies based solely on this analysis
- ❌ Claim H₁ or H₂ is "proven" without lab experiments and spatial validation
- ❌ Ignore the 10-100× larger effect of climate variables
- ❌ Generalize beyond Cambodia or beyond 2000-2019 period
